## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to assist my client with producing a webstie using JavaScript.  JavaScript will give me the ability to produce a website that is more functional and dynamic, which my client is really looking for.  My client envisions an interactive dashboard that will quickly return information to their users.  As I reviewed my client's data, it became clear that I have produced similar results; but, Python was the language of choice.  My first sprint delivered a site with dynamic filtering based on a date field in the data.  My client expressed her happiness with the visually appealing and dynamic content and asked if I could expand the filtering.  

My final sprint will include adding four (4) data keys to search on.  Along with the date filter, I will give my client the ability to filter the additional columns; additionally, add some JavaScript code that will listen for filter changes on the website.  This may be the most exciting feature of the entire application and I can't wait for my client to visualize this data utilizing all filters.  As always, my analysis followed 
the data analysis principles of (1) Determine the number of rows and columns; (2) Data types used; and (3) Is the data readable?

__Client Expected Results:__
- Creation of visually appealing and dynamic website
- Filter capability on the below data keys:
  - datetime
  - city
  - state
  - country
  - shape

## Resources
The resouces used develope this JavaScript application included;
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- JavaScript/JavaScript Events
- BootStrap
- D3 (Data-Driven Documents)

## Results
All sprints were completed as scheduled and I delivered on all client expectations/results.

__Deliverable 1:__ Creation of visually appealing and dynamic website.
- Looking at the below visualization you can see how easy on the eyes this website is.

__Deliverable 2:__ Filter capability on data keys (datetime, city, state, country, shape).
- The below visualization illustrates the data keys that can be filtered.  The data you see in each input box illustrated the type of data that should be entered by a user.  __No filter has been entered or applied.__

- The below visualization illustrates the first filter on the date; however, the filter has __NOT__ been applied.  The application is listening for a change and once a user hits the tab key the filter will be applied.

- The below visualization illustrates an applied filter on date.  You can clearly see the amount of data has decreased since applying the date filter.

- The below visualization illustrates an applied filter on __date ONLY__; however, another filter is about to be applied on city.

- The below visualization illustrates an applied filter on date and city.  The results have decreased yet again since applying on both date and city.
